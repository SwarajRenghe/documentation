# Nightly Checklists (by date, Europe/Amsterdam)

Use these like flight checks. Aim to tick everything; if short on time, do items marked **[CORE]**.

## Fri Sep 26 (Tonight)

* [CORE] 25m DSA: contains duplicate, two-sum, Kadane.
* [CORE] 25m .NET: async/await pitfalls, DI lifetimes, HttpClient lifetime → add 10 bullets to cheat sheet.
* [CORE] 15m Assignment micro-drill: 60-sec pitch ×2 + “limiter vs retry”.
* 10–20m Behavioral: STAR #1 (prod incident w/ metrics).
* 5m Debrief: note 1 win, 1 fix for Sat.

**Pass bar:** 3 DSA done ≤20m each; can recite 60-sec pitch w/o notes.

## Sat Sep 27

* [CORE] 90–120m ASP.NET Core internals + micro-exercise (minimal API + typed HttpClient + Polly + logging scope).
* [CORE] 30m DSA: sliding-window (longest substring, fixed-K max sum) + write invariant.
* [CORE] 60–90m EF Core perf: create 10 anti-pattern → fix cards.
* 40–60m Patterns: Decorator vs Strategy vs Factory (90-sec contrasts).
* 30–40m Assignment micro-drill: streaming chunks, cancellation, DNS/handler.
* 30–40m Behavioral: STAR #2 (0→1), #3 (conflict).

**Pass bar:** can explain pipeline order, one EF perf fix, and Decorator in 90s.

## Sun Sep 28

* [CORE] 90m Testing: write 2 tests for parser/stream logic.
* [CORE] 30m DSA: binary search (left/right bias; first/last).

## Wed Oct 1

* [CORE] 60m Mock coding (1 medium). Write 5-line pattern summary after.
* [CORE] 40m ASP.NET lifecycle: filters vs middleware; validation traps; exception middleware.
* [CORE] 60m **Full assignment rehearsal #1**: 8–10m pitch+diagram → grill on limiter/retry/stream/timeouts.

---

## Thu Oct 2

* [CORE] 40m DSA speed: 2 repeats sub-10m.
* [CORE] 40m .NET perf/memory: value types vs records, Span/Memory, pooling, string handling → +5 bullets.
