### Trips Galore!

I've just gotten back from a 4 day trip to the Black Forest in Germany two days ago, and as I type this I'm getting ready to leave the house for another 5 day trip to Ericeira, Portugal for surfing again.


### Interviewing
I've just submitted an asignment for Funda's interview process yesterday, and I think I did a great job. My implementation has some holes in it, but I think it's great. It's been a nice little boost in confidence as well. I should apply to more places.
